                        humanity.</p>

                            major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention
                            is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms.With
                            education being the key component in shaping the future workforce, transforming the current
                            education system through adoption of innovative and contemporary teaching and learning
                            methodologies is the need of the hour.</p>

                            potential of each
                            individual. It is based on the principle that education must develop not only cognitive
                            capacities -
                            both the ‘foundational capacities ’of literacy and numeracy and ‘higher-order’ cognitive
                            capacities,
                            such as critical thinking and problem solving – but also social, ethical, and emotional
                            capacities and
                            dispositions. </p>

                            poverty. Over the past decade, major progress was made towards increasing access to
                            education and school enrollment rates at all levels.ducation in itself is an empowering
                            right and one of the most powerful tools by which economically and socially marginalized
                            children and adults can lift themselves out of poverty and participate fully in society.</p>
